{"name":"Physical Web Project","tagline":"Based on the Physical Web","body":" <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/physical-web/master/documentation/images/logo/logo-black.png\" alt=\"Physical Web logo\" style=\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\"\"/>\r\n\r\n### What is the Physical Web and the Physical Web Project?\r\nThe Physical Web is an approach to unleash the core superpower of the web: interaction on demand. People should be able to walk up to any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car - and not have to download an app first. Everything should be just a tap away. \r\n\r\nThe number of smart devices is going to explode, and the assumption that each new device will require its own application just isn't realistic. We need a system that lets anyone interact with any device at any time. The Physical Web isn't about replacing native apps: it's about enabling interaction when native apps just aren't practical.\r\n\r\nThe Physical Web Project is the Google Summer of Code proposal for university students interested in developing applications around that technology. The Physical Web Project, while making use of [Physical Web](https://google.github.io/physical-web/) software, does not develop the Physical Web code-base itself. Physical Web is an open standard that everyone can use. By creating a common web standard that any device can use to offer interaction, a new range of services becomes possible. Instead, the Physical Web Project works on extending the Physical Web system with open source software enabling open source applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What kinds of skills or experience should you bring?\r\n* Programming in Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS3 or other languages.\r\n* Experience with Mobile environment, including Android.\r\n* Experience with Wireless development, including Bluetooth Low Energy.\r\n* Experience in small PC like systems such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Beagle Board.\r\n* Technical experience with other Internet of Things systems.\r\n\r\n### Suggested GSoC 2016 Project Ideas\r\n\r\nWe have plenty of great things you could work on, here are some briefly described and to be developed, but first take a look at the [ideas page](http://google.github.io/physical-web/cookbook/) from the main web site. \r\nAnd also remember that you can propose us with your ideas.\r\n* Person identifier for Emergency situations\r\n* Smartphone Auto Setting\r\n* Guide me for blind people\r\n* Local Air & Weather Info\r\n* Interactive License Plate for Drones\r\n* BYOP (Bring Your Own POIS)\r\n\r\n### Interested? What you have to do next...\r\n\r\nIf you want to make a proposal as student, point your browser to the [main GSoC 2016 site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and follow the instructions there. If you need to reach us directly for any cause, contact us by [email](mailto://physicalwebproject@gmail.com).\r\n\r\nGood Luck!\r\n\r\nAndreu Ibañez, Cándido Caballero-Gil & Paco Martín-Fernández (Physical Web Project GSoC Organizer and mentors)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

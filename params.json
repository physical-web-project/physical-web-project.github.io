{"name":"Physical Web Project","tagline":"Physical Web","body":"### What is The Physical Web and the Physical Web Project?\r\nThe Physical Web is an approach to unleash the core superpower of the web: interaction on demand. People should be able to walk up to any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car - and not have to download an app first. Everything should be just a tap away. \r\n\r\nThe number of smart devices is going to explode, and the assumption that each new device will require its own application just isn't realistic. We need a system that lets anyone interact with any device at any time. The Physical Web isn't about replacing native apps: it's about enabling interaction when native apps just aren't practical.\r\n\r\n//TODO: Definition Physical Web Project\r\n\r\nThe Physical Web Project, while making use of [Physical Web](https://google.github.io/physical-web/) software, does not develop the Physical Web code-base itself. Physical Web is an open standard that everyone can use. By creating a common web standard that any device can use to offer interaction, a new range of services becomes possible. Instead, the Physical Web Project works on extending the Physical Web system with open source software enabling open source applications.\r\n\r\n### What kinds of skills or experience should you bring?\r\n* Programming in Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS3 or other languages.\r\n* Experience with Mobile environment, including Android.\r\n* Experience with Wireless development, including Bluetooth Low Energy.\r\n* Technical experience with other Internet of Things systems.\r\n\r\n### Suggested GSoC 2016 Project Ideas\r\n\r\nWe have plenty of great things you could work on!

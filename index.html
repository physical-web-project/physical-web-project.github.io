<p>The Physical Web is an approach to unleash the core superpower of the web: interaction on demand. People should be able to walk up to any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car - and not have to download an app first. Everything should be just a tap away. </p>

<p>The number of smart devices is going to explode, and the assumption that each new device will require its own application just isn't realistic. We need a system that lets anyone interact with any device at any time. The Physical Web isn't about replacing native apps: it's about enabling interaction when native apps just aren't practical.</p>

<p>The Physical Web Project is the Google Summer of Code proposal for university students interested in developing applications around that technology. The Physical Web Project, while making use of <a href="https://google.github.io/physical-web/">Physical Web</a> software, does not develop the Physical Web code-base itself. Physical Web is an open standard that everyone can use. By creating a common web standard that any device can use to offer interaction, a new range of services becomes possible. Instead, the Physical Web Project works on extending the Physical Web system with open source software enabling open source applications.</p>

<p>We have plenty of great things you could work on, here are some briefly described and to be developed, but first take a look at the <a href="http://google.github.io/physical-web/cookbook/">ideas page</a> from the main web site. 
And also remember that you can propose us with your ideas.</p>

<ul>
<li>Person identifier for Emergency situations<br>
Idea: In order to identify people in emergency or disaster situations (the beacon will link to a website with the user's health profile). The web has different profiles to show. -For normal people, police, or emergency people as a doctor or a nurse.
To be coded: A platform with users registration, tahta generates urls for the associated beacons running on a server, the frontend, the android aplication with login profile and link to liquid galaxy.<br>
Skills needed: nodeJS, angularJS, bootstrap, html, and android.</li>
<li>Smartphone Auto Setting<br>
Idea: Useful to autoset a preselected settings on the phone. E.g. When a user arrives to a place, its smartphone reads a particular beacon and it starts the silent mode.<br>
To be coded: android app that automatically starts preselected settings on the phone
Skills needed: Android<br>
</li>
<li>Guide me for blind people<br>
Idea: For people with visual problems, some beacons in the path could help to provide further information about the place or to check if it is the correct destination, it can help to ensure that the beacon provides extra information about the place until the next beacon (if there are obstacles, stairs, wide corridor, etc.)<br>
To be coded: Android app that detects different physical web beacons, check the distance and gives information via voice.
Skills needed: nodeJS, angularJS, bootstrap, html, Android<br>
</li>
<li>Local Air &amp; Weather Info<br>
Idea: To check weather information or other open data information, when a user arrives to a place, the beacon can tell, temperature, level of air pollution, etc.<br>
To be coded: Android app that check a physical web beacon and gives relevant open data information with push notifications. Backend to set locations beacons and information.<br>
Skills needed:<br>
</li>
<li>Interactive License Plate for Drones<br>
Idea: Drones are gonna be everywhere soon moving goods, medicines, and many more things. As we have the right to know what’s going on over our heads, the idea is that every drone has a PW beacon pointing to an url with information about his trip. This web page has to be dynamically generated each time the drone departs from a place to another, and if it’s in the range of the BLE radio, the user will have different informations about the drone and his trip or a fixed virtual license plate.<br>
To be coded: The application has to deal with generating a backend for different users to register his drones, and have a link to a multi drone system. Also the front end consisting on a mobile site done in Polymer, Html5, or similar modern web languages with Material Design aspect.<br>
Skills needed: Python.<br>
</li>
<li>BYOP (Bring Your Own POIS)<br>
Idea: The many Google Liquid Galaxy immersive and panoramic Google Earth viewer instances installed around the world are visited daily by school or other kind of groups. The teacher or guide usually will want to show up certain contents. The idea is to develop a backend where you can enter locations in coordinates, for different users, generating the standard XML Point of Interest file of a Liquid Galaxy on a web url. A PW beacon own by the professor or guide will trigger a small hardware arduino or rpi based in a Liquid Galaxy system to download those POIS for a session.<br>
To be coded: the multi user backend to enter the POI coordinates and metadata, the hardware script for recognizing a PW url, and the connection to a Liquid Galaxy.<br>
Skills needed: Python, whatever language you use for the hardware.<br>
</li>
</ul>
